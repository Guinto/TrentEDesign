				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Twelfth Day of Xmas, Linda Sandvik
					rounds off the 12 days with a look at the fantastically fun MaKey
					MaKeys. MaKey MaKey's are a great little tool for hacking together
					physically interactive projects in no time at all and are fun for
					any age. In our final article of the festive period Linda shows you
					some quick projects to get started hacking with the MaKey MaKeys.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Eleventh Day of Xmas, Adam Onishi takes
					a deeper look at the WordPress Loop. The Loop is used in WordPress
					to produce the content for all posts and pages displayed using the
					CMS. There are hundreds of articles, talks, and questions about the
					Loop but in this post Adam takes a deeper look at what's really
					going on within the Loop.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Tenth Day of Xmas, Mike Street looks at
					development practices and how to utilise a virtual dev environment.
					As with the previous article on Git Deployment it shows that we're
					now looking to improve our workflows, make them more robust and
					plan for many testing possibilities and collaborative working
					situations. In this article Mike draws on his experience to show
					how a virtual development environment can help.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Ninth Day of Xmas, Rob Miller talks
					about the power of deploying your projects with Git. Version
					control has become extremely popular in the recent year and this
					could largely be attributed to the rise of Git and Github. So in
					this article Rob will take you through 3 ways you can start to
					wield the full power of Git to make project deployment a breeze.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Eight Day of Xmas, Anthony Killeen looks
					at the future of page layout on the web, Flexbox. Ever since we
					started using tables for layouts we've been hacking our markup for
					layout purposes, and even the introduction of floats for layout are
					still a hack. 2013 is starting to look like a great year for the
					web.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Seventh Day of Xmas, Laura Kalbag takes
					a look at grid frameworks and how the popularity of these
					frameworks, boilerplates, base templates and the like may be taking
					away from good development. Good developers should know their code
					like the back of their hand, so take a look at why, in 2013, it
					might be worth leaving the grid frameworks as a memory of 2012.</p>

				</h2>
				<p class="intro">On the Sixth Day of Xmas, Toby Howarth takes a
					look at Object Oriented CSS. Recently it's becoming more and more
					important to right clean reusable code and with the introduction of
					OOCSS it's become easier to bring the DRY methodology to your
					stylesheets. In this article Toby introduces the basics of how to
					introduce OOCSS to your projects.</p>

					look at five of his favourite Javascript tools, which are all used
					through the command line. With developers beginning to realise that
					knowing the command line is more and more an essential part of
					their workflow, command line based tools are here to stay.</p>
